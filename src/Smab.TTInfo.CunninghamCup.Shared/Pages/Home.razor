		<p>
			The tournament was held on Saturday, August 30th 2025 and was open to all paid up
			OLOP members for the new season.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Cunningham Cup is a Handicap Tournament we began in memory of our founder,
			the late John Cunningham, and was run, pre-season, every year since his passing until COVID.
			This is the first year since then that we have revived it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ideally we begin with up to 8 groups of 3 or 4 players (so a maximum of 32 entries),
			guaranteeing a minimum of 2 or 3 matches (depending on numbers).
			The top 2 from each group will go through to the knock out stages.
			The next 2 from each group will go through to a consolation knockout stage.
			Sets will be best of 3 games to 21. The first groups will start at about 9am.
		</p>

		<p>We will then have a break for you to have lunch, followed by the knockout stages.</p>

		<p>
			We use a maximum of 3 tables at any one time so there is plenty of playing room,
			and because the tournament is handicapped anyone has a chance of winning.
			Where available handicaps will be taken from the current Reading Handicaps.
		</p>

		<p>Closing date for entries was 26th August.</p>
